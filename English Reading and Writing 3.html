  <p>Where there is a will, there is a way. This proverb means that if you are really determined to do something,
    however difficult it might be, you will 1)<strong>F</strong> eventually</p>
  <p> find a way to do it well. The 2)<strong>G</strong> premier</p>
  <p> point is that you must have the will to achieve success.</p>
  <p>Ninety percent of the failures that occur are due to the fact that there is no strong will involved. Many people
    simply say that they want something, but they do not make any 3)H endeavor</p>
  <p> to achieve it. So, instead of getting it, they use the poorest excuse to explain the situation away.</p>
  <p>On many occasions, people tend to 4)j bypass </p>
  <p> every minute obstacle, making the objective impossible to attain. In reality, if they have the will to succeed,
    they can get rid of the 5)E handicaps</p>
  <p> and achieve their goals.</p>
  <p>Only those with a(n) 6)A committed</p>
  <p> and focused will and spirit can fight their way to final victory. Many a famous man has the same experience. They
    have 7)N attained</p>
  <p> their prestige because they have had the will to 8)I transcend</p>
  <p> apparently insuperable (无法克服的) obstacles. Many artists, statesmen, writers and inventors have managed to succeed
    because they possess a fierce will, which has helped them to accomplish major 9)K feats</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>Therefore, we can see that the main thing which one needs is a strong will. Weak-willed people never climb to the
    top. They collapse at the 10)M slightest</p>
  <p> use of force against them. Strong-willed people, on the other hand, will stand up against all odds and will make
    it a point to succeed.</p>

  <p>Social anxiety symptoms often begin during adolescence. It&#39;s a developmental process that is 1)K characterized
  </p>
  <p> by profound psychological changes, especially in terms of how we relate to others. One of the most frustrating 2)D
    aspects</p>
  <p> of the adolescent years is the tendency for self-focus and a decrease in the 3)H amount</p>
  <p> of focus we have for the feelings and needs of others.</p>
  <p>While these changes are fairly universal, those of us who were born with a shy temperament (性格) can carry the
    adolescent fears, which may never 4)J recede</p>
  <p> , into adulthood. An anxious temperament causes our brains to react forcibly when 5)I exposed</p>
  <p> to the stress of sudden awareness of our peers and gradually we become more and more vulnerable. Our brains label
    the fear of exposure or embarrassment as highly dangerous. This may result in a(n) 6)O vicious</p>
  <p> circle for many years: excessive self-consciousness and inhibition when we feel we are being observed.</p>
  <p>To cope with the problem, I would like to 7)G challenge</p>
  <p> you to strive for increased focus on other people, in place of your 8)A excessive</p>
  <p> focus on yourself. Yes, I know, this is easier said than done. The fear may cause you to feel that you will lose
    control or make a fool of yourself when you are in the spotlight (聚光灯). But if you begin to build a new response, in
    9)N reaction</p>
  <p> to your fears, you will gradually build up a stronger and more positive response. Remember, don&#39;t let
    self-consciousness 10)C paralyze</p>
  <p> you! Be courageous!</p>

  <p> a particular type of fresh, vulnerable, elfin (小精灵似的) beauty. Today&#39;s 3)F polularity</p>

  <p>&quot;Why would you leave behind your comfortable bed, your home, your family and friends? Why do you want to go
    alone?&quot; When you are living out of a backpack for a period of time, you may often get questioned why. I seldom

  <p>In a study conducted in the UK, it was found that only four out of every five 1)employees</p>
  <p> were happy at work. Surprisingly, contrary to popular 2)notion</p>
  <p> , friendly, supportive colleagues and a good manager, instead of the salary or the love for the work, have been
    found to be the 3)primary</p>
  <p> causes of happiness at work. So, how do you keep your spirits up and, at the same time, 4)foster</p>
  <p> a sense of joy on the job? Here is one of the tips to help you on your way to finding happiness and complete job
    satisfaction in the workplace.</p>
  <p>Start with a positive outlook. Happiness is a state of mind; it 5)reflects</p>
  <p> an attitude, though not many people realize it. Staying happy at work is totally based on your 6)motivations</p>
  <p> and on a positive outlook toward your job, not on 7)monetary</p>
  <p> rewards or material gain. Dwelling on (老是想着) the good 8)aspects</p>
  <p> of the work rather than rattling on and on (对...喋喋不休) about what makes you unhappy is the basic key to happiness.
    Negativity and 9)gossiping</p>
  <p> about bad things may be easy, but it is looking at the bright side that makes for the challenging part of a job.
    As Francesca Reigler puts it, &quot;Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves 10)miserable</p>
  <p>, or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.&quot;</p>
