  <h2 id="passage-2">Passage 2</h2>
  <p>Nothing succeeds like confidence. When you are truly and justifiably confident, it radiates from you like sunlight,
    and attracts success to you like a magnet. It&#39;s so important to 1) <strong>believe in</strong></p>
  <p> yourself. Believe that you can do anything under any 2)<strong>circumstances</strong></p>
  <p>, because if you believe you can, then you really will. That belief just keeps you 3)<strong>scarching for</strong>
  </p>
  <p> success, and then pretty soon you can get it. Confidence is more than an attitude. It comes from knowing exactly
    where you are going, and how you are going to get there. It comes from 4)<strong>a strong sense of</strong></p>
  <p> purpose. It comes from a strong commitment to take 5)<strong>responsibility</strong></p>
  <p>, rather than just let life happen.</p>
  <p>One way to develop self-confidence is to do the thing you fear and get a record of successful experiences behind
    you. Confidence does not equal self-importance. Self-importance is born out of fear and
    6)<strong>insecurity</strong></p>
  <p>, while confidence comes from strength and 7)<strong>integrity</strong></p>
  <p>. Confidence is not just believing you can do it. Confidence is knowing you can do it, and knowing that you are
    capable of 8)<strong>accomplishing*</strong></p>
  <p> anything you want. </p>
  <p>Anything can be achieved through focused, determined effort, commitment and self-confidence. If your life is not
    what you 9)<strong>are longing for</strong></p>
  <p>, you have the power to change it, and you must make such changes on a moment by moment basis. Live with your goals
    and your plan of action, and live each moment with your 10)<strong>priorities</strong></p>
  <p> in mind, then you will have the life you want.</p>

  <h2 id="passage-2">Passage 2</h2>
  <p>Moods, say the experts, are emotions that tend to become fixed, 1)<strong>exerting</strong></p>
  <p> an influence on one&#39;s outlook for hours, days or even weeks. That&#39;s 2)<strong>fabulous</strong></p>
  <p> if your mood is a pleasant one, but it will be a problem if you are sad, anxious, angry or lonely.</p>
  <p>Perhaps one of the best ways to deal with such moods is to 3)<strong>talk them out</strong></p>
  <p>. Sometimes, though, there is no one to listen.</p>
  <p>Modern science offers an abundance of drugs to deal with bad moods. But scientists have also discovered the
    practicability of several non-drug 4)<strong>approaches</strong></p>
  <p> to release you from an unwanted mood. These can be just as useful as drugs, and have the added benefit of being
    healthier. So, the next time you feel out of sorts, don&#39;t 5)<strong>head for</strong></p>
  <p> the drug store – try the following approach.</p>
  <p>Of all the mood-altering self-help techniques, physical exercise seems to be the most 6)<strong>efficient</strong>
  </p>
  <p> cure for a bad mood. &quot;If you could keep up the exercise, you&#39;d be in high spirits,&quot; says Kathryn
    Lance, author of <em>Running for Health and Beauty</em>. Obviously, physical activity 7)<strong>is linked
      with</strong></p>
  <p> mood changes.</p>
  <p>Researchers have explained biochemical and various other changes that make exercise 8)<strong>compare favorably
      to</strong></p>
  <p> drugs as a mood-raiser. Physical exertion such as housework, however, does little help, probably because it is not
    intensive enough, and people usually do it unwillingly. The key is physical exercise – running, cycling, walking,
    swimming or other sustained activities that 9)<strong>boost</strong></p>
  <p> the heart rate, increase circulation and improve the body&#39;s use of oxygen. Do them for at least 20 minutes a
    10)<strong>session</strong></p>

  <h2 id="passage-2">Passage 2</h2>
  <p>Many neighbor disputes end up in court because of poor communication. If something dangerous or
    1)<strong>illegal</strong></p>
  <p> happens, the cops are the obvious solution. But if problems that arise are grayer, communication is the best way
    to save money and trouble. Here are some tips to be a good neighbor and deal with a bad one:</p>
  <p>• Get to know each other. Being a good neighbor doesn&#39;t mean 2)<strong>taking family vacations</strong></p>
  <p> together. Just knowing them well enough to say hi, or maybe borrowing a cup of sugar or loaning a gardening tool,
    can build trust and understanding. Issues are much more likely to occur among strangers than even casual
    3)<strong>acquaintances</strong></p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>• Head off problems before they&#39;re problems. If you are 4)<strong>throwing a party</strong></p>
  <p> at your place, go to all neighbors who might be affected and offer them two things: a 5)<strong>verbal</strong>
  </p>
  <p> invitation to the party and a card with your phone number. If they are not 6)<strong>tolerant</strong></p>
  <p> of the noise or there are other problems, your neighbors can call you instead of asking the police to
    7)<strong>intervene</strong></p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>• Tell your neighbors what&#39;s bothering you – don&#39;t assume they know what the problem is. Be open and
    direct, not passive-aggressive. Ask for their opinions, and wherever possible, propose a solution that
    8)<strong>splits the difference</strong></p>
  <p> and demonstrates a willingness to compromise. Stay cool and positive, even if your neighbors are not.</p>
  <p>• Check with other neighbors. See if anybody else on the block is having similar issues – they may be willing to
    help 9)<strong>resolve</strong></p>
  <p> it. If one of the neighbors is close to the troublemaker, have them come with you when you 10)<strong>talk it
      out</strong></p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>Bottom line? As with any relationship, being a good neighbor – or dealing with a bad one – is all about
    communication.</p>

  <h2 id="passage-2">Passage 2</h2>
  <p>Scientific research should improve our overall quality of life. The government should provide financial and
    political support to any research that is likely to result in immediate and significant benefits for the people.
    However, people&#39;s ideas 1) <strong>vary</strong></p>
  <p> when it comes to whether the government should support scientific research with no practical use. Still 2)<strong>
      a large portion of </strong></p>
  <p> people believe that the government should distribute adequate funds to any scientific research that aims to
    improve the 3) <strong>well-being</strong></p>
  <p> of people, even if it is of no practical use in the short run.</p>
  <p>Scientific research whose social benefits are immediate, predictable, and 4) <strong>profound</strong></p>
  <p> should continue to be a high priority. For example, biotechnology research has been proven to help cure and
    prevent diseases; information technology enables education to be more 5) <strong>accessible</strong></p>
  <p>; and communication technology facilitates global peace by improving mutual understanding among people and their
    participation in the democratic process.</p>
  <p>However, this is not to say that research whose benefits are less immediate or clear should be given a lower
    priority. It is difficult to predict which research will 6) <strong>ultimately</strong></p>
  <p> lead to the greatest contributions to society. Reluctance to finance less practical scientific research could 7)
    <strong>have a harmful effect on</strong>
  </p>
  <p> the efforts to explore new knowledge. This is particularly true of the computer sciences, For instance, before the
    first computer was invented, public opinions 8) <strong>went against</strong></p>
  <p> it, as most people saw nothing practical in computer research. However, computers transformed the way human
    society evolved and proved to be of great avail in the long run, especially in terms of scientific development in
    fields such as the military, medicine, 9) <strong>aviation</strong></p>
  <p>, and education.</p>
  <p>Therefore, never should we think that scientific research whose benefits are unknown 10) <strong>is not worth
      pursuing</strong></p>
  <p> since the purpose of any research should be to discover truths, whatever it might be.</p>

  <h2 id="passage-2">Passage 2</h2>
  <p>A poorly trained manager can make an employee&#39;s life miserable. In 99 out of 100 cases, employees may 1)
    <strong>suffer from</strong>
  </p>
  <p> low spirits and then gradually become no longer 2) <strong>enthusiastic</strong></p>
  <p> about their jobs just because they have a boss who doesn&#39;t approve of them, doesn&#39;t listen to them, or
    generally 3) <strong>erodes</strong></p>
  <p> their self-esteem.</p>
  <p>Three basic skills that every manager should use in order to be 4) <strong>competent</strong></p>
  <p> on the job are: being specific, enhancing others&#39; self-esteem and listening effectively. Being specific means
    giving 5) <strong>clear-cut</strong></p>
  <p> instructions about what is to be done and the results to be achieved. Being specific also means describing the
    behavior of people rather than 6) <strong>labeling</strong></p>
  <p> people. It includes giving both positive feedback that tells them what to repeat and corrective feedback that is
    firm, yet not critical. Then it 7) <strong>comes down to</strong></p>
  <p> evoking in the employees self-esteem. Self-esteem is a private, individual matter. It is not fixed, but goes up
    and down from day to day, or even from hour to hour. Thus, building self-esteem is no easy task. Managers can&#39;t
    MAKE people feel good about themselves, but rather, they need to help people develop their own self-esteem as
    self-esteem is like a door that&#39;s locked from the inside. A final skill that today&#39;s managers need more than
    ever is listening. Listening may seem like a 8) <strong>commonplace</strong></p>
  <p> skill, but it&#39;s not practiced as much as it should be in business today. People 9) <strong>tend to</strong>
  </p>
  <p> think about what they are going to say in response when another person is talking, instead of 10) <strong>focusing
      on</strong></p>
  <p> what that person is saying and what he / she means.</p>
